The RSE's duties are extensive and can be categorized as follows:  (1] **Design and Certification:** The RSE is responsible for preparing and certifying the Method Statement for construction activities. They are also the professional responsible for certifying demolition plans and reports, as well as endorsing the final certification that completed demolition works have been carried out correctly.  (2] **Geotechnical Coordination:** A specific and critical duty of the RSE is to arrange for a Registered Geotechnical Engineer to handle geotechnical submissions. The RSE ensures that these geotechnical submissions, along with all site supervisions, comply with the statutory requirements set by the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO].  (3] **Site Supervision and Endorsement:** The RSE carries out inspections on activities they deem to be critical and requiring close supervision.

In this supervisory capacity, the RSE endorses the daily site supervision reports prepared by the TCPs (Technically Competent Persons] and also endorses the certification for any required precautionary works.

These stages must be executed in accordance with an approved construction sequence, which can be found either within a formal method statement or a separately designed sequence, depending on which is applicable for the project.  Due to the inherent risks involved, EXCAVATION is a heavily regulated activity with specific requirements. Key among these are mandates for ensuring the stability of the excavated area and for providing adequate drainage to prevent water accumulation. Furthermore, the process requires thorough planning, including the submission of a proposed sequence of works and the implementation of a monitoring system to oversee the activities and ensure safety.  Before any new work, such as laying foundations or pipes, can commence within the excavation, the site must receive official approval and undergo a mandatory inspection. EXCAVATION also serves as a critical step in addressing site obstructions; it is a key component in several approved methods for overcoming obstructions, as it involves digging and removing material to physically access the impediment.)

Due to the inherent risks involved, EXCAVATION is a heavily regulated activity with specific requirements. Key among these are mandates for ensuring the stability of the excavated area and for providing adequate drainage to prevent water accumulation. Furthermore, the process requires thorough planning, including the submission of a proposed sequence of works and the implementation of a monitoring system to oversee the activities and ensure safety.  Before any new work, such as laying foundations or pipes, can commence within the excavation, the site must receive official approval and undergo a mandatory inspection.
